      Croissants are a Viennese breakfast classic that are just as delicious at
      any time of day. From savory to sweet, these pastries will fill you up and
      leave you with a satisfied feeling—perfect for breakfast or a snack. Made
      with real butter, eggs, and vanilla, these croissants make the perfect
      treat for special occasions or everyday breakfast.

      Croissants made with viennoiserie breakfast ingredients are perfect,
      delicious and perfectly formed croissants. Viennoiserie includes such
      classics as Almond Croissant, Walnut Croissant, Apricot Croissant and
      Chocolate Croissant. Unique flavors such as Pistachio, Berry and Hazelnut
      will tantalize your taste buds for a sweet but savory morning pastry. They
      are easy to make and require very few ingredients that you probably
      already have on hand.
